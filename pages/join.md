# Joining Planetlab

PlanetLab Europe welcomes companies, universities, and research laboratories 
across Europe and around the world to join the testbed.

## Users

You can create an account and join a Team or a Workspace 
(within your institution or as an external user)

You can also request the creation of a new Team depending on your position at your institution.

If you are a student or an intern and your institution is not present in PlanetLab please ask your 
supervisor to register and request to create a Team.
Once the validation process is over they will be able to authorize your account.

Ple [console](https://console.edge-net.org/)

## Teams

A Team can be requested if you are in an authoritative or managerial position at your institution:
we welcome professors, instructors who wish to use PlanetLab for laboratory exercises for their classes,
researchers, companies CEOs, CTOs etc.
Please provide an institutional e-mail address when registering.

PlanetLab administrators will verify the information that you provide and, once approved, you will be 
able to manage your team, ask your users to join and manage workspaces.

Team owners and administrators do _not_ need to be familiar with Docker or Kubernetes, 
they can perform all authorizations via the web console and they can delegate authorization
responsibility to a team member.

## Workspaces

As a manager of your Team you will be able to create a Workspace or approve requests from your users.
With a Workspace you will be able to start to work on your project!
