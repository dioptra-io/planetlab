## About

PlanetLab, established in 2002, is a global network of computers available as a testbed 
for computer networking and distributed systems research. As of December 2011, PlanetLab 
was composed of 1024 nodes at 530 sites worldwide. Each research project runs a "slice", 
that gives experimenters access to a virtual machine on each node attached to that slice.
